# Tech Stack Document for truth-time-tracker

This document explains, in everyday language, why we chose each technology for the truth-time-tracker project. It covers the frontend, backend, infrastructure, third-party integrations, security, performance, and a summary of how everything fits together.

## Frontend Technologies

We built the user interface—the part people see and click—using these tools:

- **Next.js (App Router)**  
  Offers file-based routing, server-side rendering (SSR), and static site generation (SSG). This means pages load quickly, and we can pre-render content for performance and SEO benefits.

- **React**  
  A popular library for building reusable UI components (buttons, forms, lists). React’s component-based approach makes the interface maintainable and easy to extend.

- **TypeScript**  
  Adds a layer of safety by checking our code as we write it. It catches errors early and makes the code easier to understand.

- **Global CSS & Custom Fonts**  
  We use a single `globals.css` file to define site-wide styles (colors, spacing, typography). Custom font files (`.woff`) ensure consistent branding and readability.

- **Context Providers**  
  Manage shared state (for example, user authentication status or theme settings) across the app without passing props through many layers.

## Backend Technologies

The backend handles data storage, business logic, and integrations behind the scenes:

- **Next.js API Routes**  
  Built-in serverless endpoints (`/app/api/webhooks/route.ts`) let us receive and process incoming webhooks or user requests without running a separate server.

- **Node.js & TypeScript**  
  These drive our server logic. TypeScript ensures consistency between frontend and backend code.

- **Database (PostgreSQL + Prisma)**  
  We recommend using PostgreSQL—a reliable, open-source database—and Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to read/write data in a safe, structured way. This combination makes it easy to model entities like users, projects, and time entries.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

These choices keep our application running smoothly and let us ship updates quickly:

- **Version Control (Git & GitHub)**  
  All code lives in a GitHub repository to track changes and collaborate safely.

- **Hosting (Vercel)**  
  Automatically deploys our Next.js app on every push to the main branch. Vercel handles serverless functions for our API routes and global CDN for fast content delivery.

- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**  
  Runs automated checks—linting, type checking, and tests—on every pull request. This prevents errors from reaching production.

- **Environment Variables**  
  Securely store keys and configuration (database URLs, webhook secrets) outside of the codebase.

## Third-Party Integrations

Our webhook endpoint and potential connectors let the time tracker communicate with external services:

- **Webhook Receiver**  
  A dedicated API route listens for events (for example, new entries from another app) and processes them in real time.

- **Zapier / IFTTT / Slack / Email**  
  Although not limited to these, our design makes it easy to plug in any service that supports webhooks. This could include notifications (Slack), automated workflows (Zapier), or calendar syncing.

- **Analytics (Google Analytics / Plausible)**  
  Track user behavior, page load times, and feature usage to make data-driven improvements.

## Security and Performance Considerations

We follow best practices to keep user data safe and ensure a snappy experience:

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Plan to use NextAuth.js (or a similar library) for secure user sign-in and session management. Only valid users can access private pages and API routes.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  Use a library like Zod to check and clean all incoming data—especially from webhooks—to prevent injection attacks.

- **Secret Management & Rate Limiting**  
  Store all credentials in environment variables. Protect API routes with rate-limit checks to prevent abuse.

- **HTTPS Everywhere**  
  Vercel automatically provides SSL certificates, ensuring encrypted connections by default.

- **Performance Optimizations**  
  • Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Generation (SSG) for fast initial loads  
  • Image and font optimization via Next.js’ built-in features  
  • Code splitting to download only what users need on each page

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

truth-time-tracker brings together modern, battle-tested technologies to deliver a fast, secure, and maintainable time-tracking experience:

- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript + global CSS + custom fonts  
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes + Node.js + TypeScript  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM  
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub + GitHub Actions + Vercel + environment variables  
- **Integrations**: Flexible webhook receiver, optional connectors (Slack, Zapier), analytics tools  
- **Security & Performance**: NextAuth.js, input validation, rate limiting, SSR/SSG, code splitting

Every choice in this stack contributes to our goals of reliability, ease of development, and a smooth user experience. By building on Next.js and TypeScript, we ensure consistency across the entire project. Hosting on Vercel with automated CI/CD guarantees fast, safe deployments. Finally, our modular approach to webhooks and integrations keeps the application extensible as new services emerge.
