# Security Guideline Document for "truth-time-tracker"

This document outlines security best practices tailored to the truth-time-tracker codebase, a Next.js/TypeScript time-tracking application with webhook integrations. Adhering to these guidelines will help ensure a secure, resilient, and maintainable system.

---

## 1. Authentication & Access Control

- **User Authentication**  
  • Implement a robust session-based or token-based authentication (e.g., NextAuth.js, Clerk, or Auth0).  
  • Enforce strong password policies (min. 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).  
  • Store passwords using Argon2 or bcrypt with unique salts.

- **Session & Token Security**  
  • Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=strict cookies for session IDs.  
  • Rotate and renew session tokens periodically; implement idle and absolute timeouts.  
  • If JWTs are used, sign with a strong secret or asymmetric key (RS256), enforce `exp` checks, and validate algorithm strictly.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  • Define clear roles (e.g., `admin`, `user`, `webhook-client`).  
  • Enforce authorization checks on every server-side API route and page.  
  • Store role/permission claims in a secure session or token; never rely on client-side checks alone.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  • Offer MFA for sensitive operations (e.g., account settings, exporting reports) via TOTP or SMS/email OTP.

## 2. Input Validation & Output Encoding

- **Server-Side Validation**  
  • Treat all inputs (forms, query params, headers, webhook payloads) as untrusted.  
  • Use a validation library (e.g., Zod, Joi) to enforce schema, types, field lengths, and formats.

- **Prevent Injection Attacks**  
  • Use parameterized queries or an ORM (e.g., Prisma) to interact with the database.  
  • Sanitize environment variables and any dynamic code paths.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  • Escape user-provided data in JSX; Next.js’s Automatic Escaping protects most contexts but verify dangerous HTML insertion.  
  • Employ a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**  
  • For state-changing API routes, implement CSRF tokens (e.g., `next-csrf`).  
  • Verify the Origin and Referrer headers on sensitive requests.

---

## 3. Data Protection & Privacy

- **Transport Encryption**  
  • Enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) on all endpoints.  
  • Use HSTS (`Strict-Transport-Security` header).

- **Encryption at Rest**  
  • Encrypt sensitive fields (PII) at the database level if supported.  
  • Use AES-256 encryption for any stored tokens or files.

- **Secret Management**  
  • Do not hardcode API keys, database credentials, or webhook secrets in the repo.  
  • Leverage a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) or environment variables with proper access controls.

- **Logging & Error Handling**  
  • Avoid exposing stack traces or PII in error responses.  
  • Log errors and audit events centrally (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) with masked sensitive data.

---

## 4. API & Webhook Security

- **Webhook Authentication**  
  • Require a shared secret or HMAC signature verification for incoming webhooks in `/app/api/webhooks/route.ts`.  
  • Reject requests missing or failing signature validation.

- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**  
  • Implement per-IP and per-API-key rate limits (e.g., using `express-rate-limit` or cloud provider features).  
  • Apply stricter limits on public or unauthenticated endpoints.

- **CORS Policy**  
  • Configure a restrictive CORS policy: whitelist trusted origins only.  
  • Disable wildcard (`*`) origins, especially for state-changing routes.

- **API Versioning**  
  • Prefix API routes (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to allow safe evolution without breaking clients.

- **Minimize Data Exposure**  
  • Return only necessary fields in JSON responses.  
  • Avoid embedding sensitive flags or internal IDs in responses.

---

## 5. Web Application Security Hygiene

- **Security Headers**  
  • `Content-Security-Policy`: restrict scripts, styles, and frame ancestors.  
  • `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`; `X-Frame-Options: DENY`; `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`.

- **Secure Cookies**  
  • Set `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite=Strict` attributes on session and refresh cookies.

- **Third-Party Scripts**  
  • Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for any external CDN assets.

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Server Hardening**  
  • Disable unused services and close non-essential ports.  
  • Apply the principle of least privilege to server and database accounts.

- **TLS Configuration**  
  • Use modern cipher suites (e.g., ECDHE+AES-GCM).  
  • Disable SSLv3/TLS 1.0/1.1.

- **Environment Configuration**  
  • Separate dev, staging, and production environments with distinct credentials and secrets.  
  • Ensure debug logging and developer tools are disabled in production builds.

- **Automated Updates & Patching**  
  • Keep the OS, Node.js, and libraries up to date.  
  • Subscribe to security advisories for dependencies.

---

## 7. Dependency Management

- **Secure Dependencies**  
  • Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`) to pin dependency versions.  
  • Regularly run SCA tools (e.g., npm audit, Snyk) to detect and remediate vulnerabilities.

- **Minimize Attack Surface**  
  • Remove unused libraries and devDependencies from production builds.

---

## 8. CI/CD & Monitoring

- **Continuous Integration**  
  • Enforce linting, type checks, and unit tests in CI pipelines.  
  • Fail builds on high-severity vulnerabilities or test coverage drop.

- **Continuous Deployment**  
  • Deploy behind a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and DDoS protection.  
  • Use blue/green or canary releases to limit blast radius.

- **Monitoring & Alerting**  
  • Instrument application metrics (errors, latency, rate limits) with real-time alerts.  
  • Audit access logs and monitor for suspicious activity (e.g., repeated failed logins, anomalous webhook traffic).

## Conclusion

By integrating these security controls at every layer—from code to infrastructure—the truth-time-tracker application will achieve defense in depth, secure defaults, and a robust posture against common threats. Regularly review and update these guidelines to align with evolving threats and project requirements.
